Hi! this is a DNS Changer written in Python and the GUI is written with CustomTkinter library; made to help iranians to get through some of the prohibitions!
you can use the source code on both Linux and Windows!
i Tested the program on Linux Mint and it worked just fine.
the program works by using shell commands in subprocess module of python!
