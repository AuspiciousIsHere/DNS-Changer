Hi! this is a DNS Changer written in Python and the GUI is written with CustomTkinter library; made to help iranians to get through some of the prohibitions!
you can use the source code on both Linux and Windows!
i Tested the program on Linux Mint and it worked just fine.
the program works by using shell commands in subprocess module of python!
for using this DNS Chnager on Windows you need to exclude the program's file from your Anti-Virus and run it as administrator. also dont forget to have internet connection.
on Linux on the other hand you dont need to do much. just run the program as sudo.
